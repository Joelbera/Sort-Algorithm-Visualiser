# Sort-Algorithm-Visualiser
A simple program designed for visualizing common sorting algorithms. Program is built entirely in Java with the use of swing. Key features of the program are:

- Slow down and speed up run time of algorithms
- Import integrer value data sets via csv files

> Project is entirely unintended for personal use as the guiding motivation behind it was to act as a simple project; however, it is not discouraged and people looking to fork or add to the project are more than welcome.
